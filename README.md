# HackdoX
A simple hugo site to document the aces hackathon.

# About this project

The objective of this project is to document all the descisions made for executing the aces dhishna 2023 hackathon.

## How we plan on implementing the project

- Use hugo for creating simple static sites.
- Host it on github ( cuz we can't be bothered with setting up our own server with ddns )
- Create 'google' forms and link it to a 'google' spreadsheet ( Time constraints, we would've created our own forms if we had the time to plan it out )
- Share the 'google' form with the respective team leads.
- Create a trigger and a hook to automatically update the site if and when a form submission happens. ( PS: We really don't wanna nag people to do it )
- If all goes well, we'll have a documentation that can be used by posterity to avoid the pitfalls and roadblocks we had.
